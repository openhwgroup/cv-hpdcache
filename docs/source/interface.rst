Some parameters are not directly related with functionality. Instead, they
allow adapting the HPDcache to physical constraints in the target technology
node. Typically, these control the geometry of SRAM macros. Depending on the
technology, some dimensions are more efficient than others (in terms of
performance, power and area). These also need to be provided by the user at
synthesis-time. :numref:`tab_synthesis_physical_parameters` lists the static
synthesis-time physical parameters of the HPDcache. The
:math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{CONF\_HPDCACHE\_ACCESS\_WORDS}` has an impact on the refill
latency (see section :ref:`sec_cache_ram_organization`).

Conventions
-----------

The HPDcache uses the following conventions in the naming of its signals:

 - The ``_i`` suffix for input ports
 - The ``_o`` suffix for output ports
 - The ``_n`` suffix for active low ports
 - The ``clk_`` suffix for clock ports
 - The ``rst_`` suffix for reset ports
 - There may be a mix of suffixes. For example ``_ni`` indicates an active-low
   input port

Cache-Requesters Interface
--------------------------------------

This section describes the Cache-Requesters Interface (CRI) between requesters
and the HPDcache. It contains two channels: one for requests and one for
responses. There are as many CRIs as requesters from the core/accelerator to
the HPDcache.

This interface is synchronous to the rising edge of the global
clock ``clk_i``.

The address (``core_req_i.addr_offset``), size (``core_req_i.size``),
byte-enable (``core_req_i.be``), write data (``core_req_i.wdata``) and
read data (``core_rsp_o.rdata``) signals shall comply with the alignment
constraints defined in section
:ref:`Address, data, and byte enable alignment <sec_req_alignment>`.

Cache Memory Interfaces
----------------------------------

This section describes the Cache-Memory Interface (CMI) between the HPDcache
and the NoC/memory. It implements 5 different channels.

This interface is synchronous to the rising edge of the global clock
``clk_i``.

All CMI interfaces implements the ready-valid protocol described in section
:ref:`sec_ready_valid_handshake` for the handshake
between the HPDcache and the NoC/Memory.

The address (``mem_req_addr``), size (``mem_req_size``),
write data (``mem_req_w_data``) and write byte-enable (``mem_req_w_be``)
signals shall comply with the alignment constraints defined in section
:ref:`Address, data, and byte enable alignment <sec_req_alignment>`.

Interfaces’ requirements
------------------------

This section describes the basic protocol transaction requirements for the
different interfaces in the HPDcache.


..  _sec_ready_valid_handshake:

Valid/Ready handshake process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All interfaces in the HPDcache use a **valid**/**ready** handshake process to
transfer a payload between the source and the destination. The payload contains
the address, data and control information.

As a reminder, the 7 interfaces in the HPDcache are the following:

#. CRI request interface
#. CRI response interface
#. CMI read request interface
#. CMI read response interface
#. CMI write request interface
#. CMI write data request interface
#. CMI write response interface

The source sets to 1 the **valid** signal to indicate when the payload is
available. The destination sets to 1 the **ready** signal to indicate that it
can accept that payload. Transfer occurs only when both the **valid** and
**ready** signals are set to 1 on the next rising edge of the clock.

A source is not permitted to wait until **ready** is set to 1 before setting
**valid** to 1.

A destination may or not wait for **valid** to set the **ready** to 1
(:numref:`cases (a) and (d) in Table %s <tab_ready_valid_scenarios>`).
In other words, a destination may set **ready** to 1 before an actual transfer
is available.

When **valid** is set to 1, the source must keep it that way until the
handshake occurs. This is, at the next rising edge when both **valid** and
**ready** (from the destination) are set to 1. In other words, a source cannot
retire a pending **valid** transfer
(:numref:`Case (b) in Table %s <tab_ready_valid_scenarios>`).

After an effective transfer (**valid** and **ready** set to 1), the source may
keep **valid** set to 1 in the next cycle to signal a new transfer (with a new
payload). In the same manner, the destination may keep **ready** set to 1 if it
can accept a new transfer. This allows back-to-back transfers, with no idle
cycles, between a source and a destination
(:numref:`Case (d) in Table %s <tab_ready_valid_scenarios>`).

All interfaces are synchronous to the rising edge of the same global
clock (``clk_i``).

CRI Response Interface
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In the case of the CRI response interfaces, there is a particularity.
For these interfaces, it is assumed that the **ready** signal is always set to
1. That is why the **ready** signal is not actually implemented on those
interfaces. In other words, the requester unconditionally accepts any incoming
response.

.. _sec_req_alignment:

Address, data and byte enable alignment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Address alignment
'''''''''''''''''

The address transferred (**addr**) in all request interfaces (CRI and CMI)
shall be byte-aligned to the value of the corresponding **size** signal in that
interface.

Some examples are illustrated in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig_request_data_alignment>`. In the first case, the
**size** value is 2 (which corresponds to :math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{2^2=4}` bytes).
Thus, the address must be a multiple of 4; In the second case, **size** value
is 3. Thus, the address must be a multiple of 8. Finally, in the third case,
**size** value is 0. Thus, there is no constraint on the address alignment.

Data alignment
''''''''''''''

The data must be naturally aligned to the address (**addr**) and the maximum
valid bytes of the transfer must be equal to :math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{2^{size}}`.
This means that the first valid byte in the **data** signal must be at the
indicated offset of the address. Here, the offset corresponds to the least
significant bits of the address, that allow to indicate a byte within the
**data** word. For example, if the **data** signal is 128 bits wide (16
bytes), then the offset corresponds to the first 4 bits of the **addr** signal.

Some examples are illustrated in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig_request_data_alignment>`. As illustrated, within the
data word, only bytes in the range from the indicated offset in the address, to
that offset plus :math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{2^{size}}` can contain valid data. Other bytes must
be ignored by the destination.

Additionally, within the range described above, the **be** signal indicates
which bytes within that range are actually valid. Bytes in the **data**
signal where the **be** signals are set to 0, must be ignored by the
destination.

Byte Enable (BE) alignment
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The **be** signal must be naturally aligned to the address (**addr**) and the
number of bits set in this signal must be less or equal to
:math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{2^\text{size}}`. This means that the first valid bit in the
**be** signal must be at the indicated offset of the address. The offset is
the same as the one explained above in the "Data alignment" paragraph.

Some examples are illustrated in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig_request_data_alignment>`. As illustrated, within the
**be** word, only bits in the range from the indicated offset in the address,
to that offset plus :math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{2^{size}}` can be set. Other bits
outside that range must be set to 0.

Cache-Requesters Interface (CRI) Attributes
-------------------------------------------

.. _sec_vipt:

Physical or Virtual Indexing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HPDcache allows the address and physical memory attributes (PMA) to be sent
by the requesters in two different (but consecutive) cycles.

This is useful to allow the pipelining of the address translation mechanism
(when the core has one). This is illustrated in
:numref:`Figure %s <fig_vipt>`.
Doing the translation and directly forwarding to the cache is usually too
costly in terms of timing. Instead, the requesters can:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 15 85
   :header-rows: 0

   * - Cycle 0
     - During the first cycle, forward the least significant bits of the
       address (``addr_offset``), which usually do not need to be translated,
       along with the other fields of the request (operation, identifiers,
       etc). In the meanwhile the core can perform the translation of the
       address to compute the most significant bits (``addr_tag``)

   * - Cycle 1
     - During the second cycle, forward the previously translated most
       significant bits of the address (``addr_tag``), and the corresponding
       PMAs. PMAs are sent during this second cycle because usually they depend
       on the target physical address. The requester can abort the request
       during this cycle as explained in the next section (:ref:`sec_req_abort`).

.. _fig_vipt:

.. figure:: images/hpdcache_vipt.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: Pipelining of the Virtual and Physical Part of the Address

   Pipelining of the Virtual and Physical Part of the Address

This kind of indexing is named **Virtually-Indexed Physically-Tagged (VIPT)**.

The requester shall send the tag and PMAs the next cycle after the
``core_req_valid_i`` and ``core_req_ready_o`` signals were set to 1 and the
``core_req_i.phys_indexed`` signal was set to 0.The number of bits of the
address offset (``addr_offset``) depends on the number of cache sets
(:math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{CONF\_HPDCACHE\_SETS}`) and the size of the cachelines
(:math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{CONF\_HPDCACHE\_CL\_WIDTH/8}`).
The address offset represents the concatenation of these two fields of the
address: the byte offset in the cacheline and the set index. Requests can be
sent back-to-back with no idle cycle in-between.

If requesters do not need virtual indexing, they can send the full address in
the first cycle by setting the ``core_req_i.phys_indexed`` bit to 1. The address
offset and the tag shall be sent through the ``core_req_i.addr_offset`` and
``core_req_i.addr_tag``, respectively. A given requester is free to alternate
between virtual and physical indexing on different clock cycles. Different
requesters can use different indexing schemes (virtual or physical).

.. _sec_req_abort:

Request Abortion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the virtual indexing, the requester can abort the request during the
second cycle of the addressing pipeline. In that case, the requester needs to
set the req_abort signal to 1.

When a request is aborted, and the ``core_req_i.need_rsp`` field was set to 1, the
HPDcache respond to the corresponding requester with the bit
``core_rsp_o.aborted`` set to 1.

CRI Type of Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A requester indicates the required operation on the 4-bit, ``HPDCACHE_REQ_OP``
signal. The supported operation are detailed in :numref:`tab_req_op_types`.

     - Cache Management Operation (CMO)

Load and store operations are normal read and write operations from/to the
specified address.

Atomic operations are the ones specified in the Atomic (A) extension of the
[RISCVUP2019]_. More details on how the HPDcache implements AMOs are found in
section :ref:`sec_amo`.

CMOs are explained in :ref:`sec_cmo`.

Source identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each request identifies its source through the ``core_req_i.sid`` signal. The
``core_req_i.sid`` signal shall be decoded when the ``core_req_valid_i`` signal
is set to 1. The width of this signal is
:math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{CONF\_HPDCACHE\_REQ\_SRC\_ID\_WIDTH}` bits.
The HPDcache reflects the value of the **sid** of the request into the
corresponding **sid** of the response.

Each port must have a unique ID that corresponds to its number. Each port is
numbered from 0 to N-1. This number shall be constant for a given port
(requester). The HPDcache uses this information to route responses to the
correct requester.

Transaction identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each request identifies transactions through the
``core_req_i.tid`` signal. The
``core_req_i.tid`` signal shall be decoded when the
``core_req_valid_i`` signal is set to 1. The width of this signal is
:math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{CONF\_HPDCACHE\_REQ\_TRANS\_ID\_WIDTH}` bits.

This signal can contain any value from 0 to
:math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{2^{CONF\_HPDCACHE\_REQ\_TRANS\_ID\_WIDTH} - 1}`.
The HPDcache forwards the value of the **tid** of the request into the **tid**
of the corresponding response.

A requester can issue multiple transactions without waiting for earlier
transactions to complete. Because the HPDcache can respond to these transactions
in a different order than the one of requests, the requester can use the **tid**
to match the responses with respect to requests.

The ID of transactions is not necessarily unique. A requester may reuse a given
transaction ID for different transactions. That is, even when some of these
transactions are not yet completed. However, when the requester starts multiple
transactions with the same **tid**, it cannot match responses and requests
because responses can be in a different order that the one of requests.


.. _sec_req_cacheability:

Cacheability
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This cache considers that the memory space is segmented. A segment corresponds
to an address range: a **base address** and an **end address**. Some segments
are cacheable and others not. The HPDcache needs to know which segments are
cacheable to determine if for a given read request, it needs to copy the read
data into the cache.

The request interface implements an uncacheable bit
(``core_req_i.pma.uncacheable`` or ``core_req_pma_i.uncacheable``).  When this
bit is set, the access is considered uncacheable. The
``core_req_i.pma.uncacheable`` signal shall be decoded when the
``core_req_valid_i`` signal is set to 1. The ``core_req_pma_i.uncacheable``
shall be decoded when the ``core_req_valid_i``, ``core_req_ready_o`` and the
``core_req_i.phys_indexed`` signals were set to 1 the previous cycle.

.. admonition:: Caution
   :class: caution

   For a given address, the uncacheable attribute must be consistent between
   accesses. The granularity is the cacheline. **In the event that the same
   address is accessed with different values in the uncacheable attribute, the
   behavior of the cache for that address is unpredictable**.

Need response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any given request, a requester can set the bit ``core_req_i.need_rsp`` to 0
to indicate that it does not want a response for that request. The
``core_req_i.need_rsp`` signal shall be decoded when the ``core_req_valid_i``
signal is set to 1.

When ``core_req_i.need_rsp`` is set to 0, the HPDcache processes the request
but it does not send an acknowledgement to the corresponding requester when the
transaction is completed.

Error response
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The response interface contains a single-bit ``core_rsp_o.error`` signal.  This
signal is set to 1 by the HPDcache when some error condition occurred during the
processing of the corresponding request. The ``core_rsp_o.error`` signal shall
be decoded when the ``core_rsp_valid_o`` signal is set to 1.

When the ``core_rsp_o.error`` signal is set to 1 in the response, the effect of
the corresponding request is undefined. If this **error** signal is set in the
case of **LOAD** or **AMOs** operations, the **rdata** signal does not contain
any valid data.

Cache-Memory Interface (CMI) Attributes

Type of operation per CMI request channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a reminder, the HPDcache implements two request channels to the memory:

#. Memory read request channel
#. Memory write request channel

:numref:`tab_optypes_by_cmi_req_channel` indicates the type of
operations that each of these two request channels can issue.

.. _tab_optypes_by_cmi_req_channel:

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Type
     - Channels

     - - CMI read request
   * - ``HPDCACHE_MEM_WRITE``
     - - CMI write request
   * - ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC``
     - - CMI write request


Read-Modify-Write Atomic Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following atomic operations behave as read-modify-write operations:

- ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_ADD``
- ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_CLR``
- ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_SET``
- ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_EOR``
- ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_SMAX``
- ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_SMIN``
- ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_UMAX``
- ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_UMIN``
- ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_SWAP``

These requests are forwarded to the memory through the CMI write request
interface. A particularity of these requests is that they generate two responses
from the memory:

#. Old data value from memory is returned through the CMI read response
   interface.

#. Write acknowledgement is returned through the CMI write response interface.

Both responses may arrive in any given order to the initiating HPDcache.

Regarding errors, if any response has its **error** signal set to 1
(``mem_resp_*_i.mem_resp_r_error`` or ``mem_resp_*_i.mem_resp_w_error``), the
HPDcache considers that the operation was not completed. It waits for both
responses and it forwards an error response (``core_rsp_o.error = 1``) to the
corresponding requester on the HPDcache requesters’ side.


Exclusive Load/Store Atomic Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exclusive load and store operations are issued as normal load and store
operations on the CMI read request interface and CMI write request interface,
respectively.

Specific operation types are however used on these exclusive requests:
``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_LDEX`` for loads; and
``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_STEX`` for stores.

These requests behave similarly to normal load and store to the memory but
provide some additional properties described in :ref:`sec_amo`.

In the case of the ``HPDCACHE_MEM_ATOMIC_STEX`` request, the write
acknowledgement contains an additional information in the
``mem_resp_w_is_atomic`` signal.
If this signal is set to 1, the exclusive store was "atomic", hence the data was
written in memory.
If this signal is set to 0, the exclusive store was "non-atomic". Hence the
write operation was abandoned.

The HPDcache uses exclusive stores in case of SC operations from requesters.
Depending on the ``mem_resp_w_is_atomic`` value, the HPDcache responds to the
requester according to the rules explained in :ref:`sec_amo`. A "non-atomic"
response is considered a **SC Failure**, and a "atomic" response is considered a
**SC Success**.

CMI Transaction identifier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each request identifies transactions through the ``mem_req_*_o.mem_req_id``
signals. The ``mem_req_*_o.mem_req_id`` signal shall be decoded when the
``mem_req_*_valid_o`` signal is set to 1. The width of these ID signals is
:math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{CONF\_HPDCACHE\_MEM\_ID\_WIDTH}` bits.

The target (memory or peripheral) shall respond to a request by setting the
``mem_resp*_i.mem_resp_*_id`` signal to the corresponding
``mem_req*_i.mem_req_id``.

``mem_req_*_o.mem_req_id`` signals can contain any value from 0 to
:math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{2^CONF\_HPDCACHE\_MEM\_ID\_WIDTH - 1}`.

The HPDcache can issue multiple memory transactions without waiting for earlier
transactions to complete. The HPDcache uses unique IDs for each request.  Unique
IDs means that two or more in-flight requests never share the same ID. In-flight
requests are those that have been issued by the HPDcache but have not yet
received their respective response.

The target (memory or peripheral) of the in-flight request may respond to CMI
in-flight requests in any order.


- **Transaction IDs in the CMI read request channel**

The HPDcache can have the following number of in-flight read miss transactions:

   :math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{CONF\_HPDCACHE\_MSHR\_SETS{}\times{}CONF\_HPDCACHE\_MSHR\_WAYS}`

Each in-flight transaction has a unique transaction ID. This ID is formatted as
follows:

   - For cacheable requests:

   ``(mshr_way << log2(HPDCACHE_MSHR_SETS)) | mshr_set``

   The ID is the concatenation of two indexes: the MSHR set and the MSHR way
   occupied by the corresponding request.

   - For uncacheable requests

   The HPDcache can issue up to 1 in-flight, uncached, read transaction.
   Uncached transactions have a unique transaction ID with all bits set to 1.


- **Transaction IDs in the CMI wbuf write request channel**

The HPDcache can have the following number of in-flight write transactions:

   :math:`\scriptsize\mathsf{CONF\_HPDCACHE\_WBUF\_DIR\_ENTRIES}`

Each in-flight transaction has a unique transaction ID. This ID is formatted as
follows:

  - For cacheable requests:

   The ID corresponds to the index of the entry in the write-buffer directory.

   ``wbuf_dir_index``


  - For uncacheable requests

    The HPDcache can issue up to 1 in-flight, uncached, write transaction.
    Uncached transactions have a unique transaction ID with all bits set to 1.


Event signals
-------------

In addition to the performance registers explained in :ref:`sec_perf_counters`,
the HPDcache provides a set of one-shot signals that indicate when a given event
is detected.  These signals are set to 1 for one cycle each time the
corresponding event is detected. If the same event is detected N cycles in a
row, the corresponding event signal will remain set to 1 for N cycles.
:numref:`Table %s <tab_events>` lists these event signals.

These event signals are output-only. They can be either left unconnected, if
they are not used, or connected with the remainder of the system. The system can
use those signals, for example, for counting those events externally or for
triggering some specific actions.
